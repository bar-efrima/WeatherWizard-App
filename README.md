# WeatherWizard-App
I developed a cross-platform weather app using React Ionic. 
It allows users to select a city from a dropdown menu and fetches the current weather for that city.
The app features moving cloud effects and has a custom background and logo.
When the user selects a city,  an http request is created to a free weather api and in that request
I retrieve the current weather in the chosen city. The weather displayed in celsius.
